			"The gods Odin, Vili and VÃ© fashioned the Earth from Ymir's flesh, from his blood
			the ocean, from his bones the hills, from his hair the trees, from his brains the
			clouds, from his skull the heavens, and from his eyebrows the middle realm in

		Ymir is an ongoing project of mine to learn procedural generation techniques.
		For now, Ymir isn't finished.
		It serves it's purpose of providing a platform for experimentation,
		but there are no plans for it to become a full-blown application.
		<br>
		<br>
		So far I've implemented Perlin and Open Simplex Noise and have used Voronoi Polygons for continent simulation.
		<br>
		<br>
		Ymir also can interpret the generated world in different ways for different types of maps.
		For example elevation can be shown with color or topography.

		Ymir is currently written in Go and previously in Java. I switched languages both to learn Go and move away from OOP.
		<br>
		<br>
		<center>Ymir currently lives as a web app in the browser.</center>
