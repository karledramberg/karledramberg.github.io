	Ymir is an under-development world generator I concieved of in late 2018. Ymir has gone through many iterations and development stages.
	Currently Ymir creates simple random maps from terrain, but I am working to expand the project to include climate, biomes, and political boundaries.
    <br>
    <br>
	To generate terrain, I use my own implementation of Perlin and Open Simplex noise. I also generate Voronoi polygons to simulate continents - this splits the maps into large polygons and creates smooth noise.
	In the future I am planning to add plate tectonics simulation.
    <br>
    <br>
    Here are examples of two elevation maps generated with Perlin noise shown with a color scale and topographic levels.

    Ymir is current written in Go and previously in Java. I switched languages both to learn Go and move away from object-oriented programming. In short OOP is the only paradigm I had coded in since learning Java in 2014 and learning a procedural language like Go was very influential in learning how I like to code.
