Ymir is an experiment in 2d procedural world-generation.

> "The gods Odin, Vili and VÃ© fashioned the Earth from Ymir's flesh, from his blood the ocean, from his bones the hills, from his hair the trees, from his brains the clouds, from his skull the heavens, and from his eyebrows the middle realm in which mankind lives, Midgard."
>    [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ymir)

This project is mostly for me to learn common procedural generation techniques (eg. Perlin noise).

A world is generated upon user request and different view-modes are available for elevation, political boundaries, climate, and biome.

It is all currently a work in progress, but development does happen twice a year or so.
