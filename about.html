	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>
		I grew up and still live in the rural town of Kirksville, Missouri. After attending a
		summer camp, I became hooked on programming or anything else computer
		related. A few years later I found my father's old film camera in a
		closet. These started my love for the two creative mediums you'll find on
		this site: photographs and software.
		<br>
		<br>
		If you are a recruiter, <a href="assets/about/resume.pdf">here</a> is a more formal r&eacute;sum&eacute;.
	</p>
	<h2>Photography</h2>
	<p>
		For now, I'm focusing on photographing my hometown. It can be a struggle
		to find new things to photograph in a small, familiar town but I welcome
		the challenge. Photographing one place means I see it in all seasons and
		in all states. I have sub projects within this project - such as 
		Through Windows or <a href="photographs/multiplied_night.html">Multiplied Night</a>. From this
		collections of photographs, I'm hoping to produce a book around the time
		I move away after university.
		<br>
		<br>
		Some erata for the photographers who found my site: my favorite camera is an old 1980s
		<a href="http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Bronica_SQ">Bronica</a> 6x6 medium format film camera,
		much of my work is shot on film with this or my father's old <a href="http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Canon_A-1">Canon A-1</a> 35mm SLR,
		I'm a sucker for some well exposed color-positive film, I'm currently trying to set up a color darkroom in my parents garage,
		my favorite photographers are, in no particular order:
		<a href="https://codycobb.com">Cody Cobb</a>,
		<a href="https://jasonleefilm.com">Jason Lee</a>,
		<a href="https://stephenshore.net">Stephen Shore</a>, and
		<a href="https://toddhido.com">Todd Hido</a>
		(these tend to change often).
