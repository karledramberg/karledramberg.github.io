Pink Floyd Hourly is fairly simple, it's just a Twitter-bot for tweeting Pink Floyd lyrics every hour, on the hour.

It runs off of a basic Python script using the [tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org) library and a simple Linux crob job.

Thanks to [@ejmg](https://github.com/ejmg) for a great tutorial.
